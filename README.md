# Monte-Carlo-Option-pricer
This is a European Option pricing algorithm, utilising Monte Carlo random simulation, developed by me taking inspiration from the QuantPy youtube channel and other resources from the internet.
I used the yahoo finance library to get up to date stock data and option chain data. Then used the 3 month treasury bill rates to calculate an estime for the risk free rate of return.
